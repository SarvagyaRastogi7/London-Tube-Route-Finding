def process_tubedata(df):
    """
    Process a DataFrame containing London Tube data to create useful data structures for an AI route finder.

    The function reads tube data with columns representing station names, connection details, and zone information.
    It constructs two dictionaries: one mapping each station to its directly connected stations with associated travel
    costs, and another mapping each station to its respective zones.

    Parameters:
    - df (pandas.DataFrame): A DataFrame with each row formatted as:
      [StartingStation], [EndingStation], [TubeLine], [AverageTimeTaken], [MainZone], [SecondaryZone]
      where `AverageTimeTaken` is the travel time in minutes, `MainZone` is the main zone of the starting station,
      and `SecondaryZone` is the secondary zone of the starting station (or 0 if it doesn't span multiple zones).

    Returns:
    - tuple:
        - station_dict (defaultdict of list): A dictionary where each key is a station name and each value is a list of 
          tuples (connected station, travel cost, line name).
        - zone_dict (defaultdict of set): A dictionary where each key is a station name and each value is a set of zones 
          that station belongs to. If a station's secondary zone is not 0, it's added to both the start and end stations.

    Example usage:
    >>> df = pandas.read_csv("tubedata.csv")
    >>> station_dict, zone_dict = process_tubedata(df)
    >>> print(station_dict["Bank/Monument"])

    Perform a heuristic best-first search to find a path between two stations using zone information as a heuristic.
    How will your heuristic work?

    Parameters:
    - start_station (str): The starting station name.
    - end_station (str): The destination station name.
    - station_dict (dict): A dict where each key is a station name, and each value is a list of tuples (connected station, travel cost, line name).
    - zone_dict (dict): A dictionary mapping each station to its zone.

    Returns:
    - list: A path from start_station to end_station as a list of station names, or an empty list if no path is found.
    - set: the names of the stations that were visited by the algorithm
    - int: the total travel time for the path found
